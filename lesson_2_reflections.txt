What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates the hidden .git files that enable you to
start making and tracking your commits. It does not itself make a commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It enables you to isolate the files which you want to add to your repository
before you commit.
