When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working as a team, or when making sure that the work is backed up.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to be in full control of your system. You may be working on an older version
of the repository on purpose. Maybe there are bugs in the new version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
A branch is used during development to make changes to the code that you might want
to keep separate from the master branch. A clone is a copy of a repository, usually
used to share work between different devices. It is typically used at the start
of a project. A fork is used when cloning somebody else's work, it is similar to a
clone but allows tracking and makes it easier for changes in forks to be shared with
the original fork repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It enables you to understand what has already been shared with others.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would use another similar service. Without any github collaborative type service
it would be much more manual to merge changes and keep track of versions etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to make a pull request. When you want to test features before committing them
to the core product.
